## Checking keyboard layout

There are 4 layouts defined in the pogo driver. 
I used the output of `cat /sys/pogo/status/keylayout_ver` while the keyboard was attached. 
You must check this with the keyboard attached and recognized, else it will incorrectly return `0`. 

This number maps to the index [here](https://github.com/justintout/linux/blob/1328c1f10cb4b68b6ee0b35be9dc4975424d2827/drivers/misc/rm-pogo/pogo_kpad.c#L468). 
Edit whichever `.keymap` is defined for your index. 


Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
